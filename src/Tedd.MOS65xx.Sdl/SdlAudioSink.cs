/// <para>
/// Create the sink first and build the <see cref="EmulatorSession"/> with <see cref="SampleRate"/>: the device is
/// opened with <c>SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE</c>, so it may run at its native rate (48000 Hz is common) instead of
/// the requested one and the emulator's resampler then produces exactly that rate.

/// <c>SDL_ClearQueuedAudio</c> are thread-safe, so no marshalling to the SDL main thread is needed.
/// Latency control: when the queue is empty (start-up, after <see cref="Clear"/>, after an underrun) a short block of
/// silence is queued first so the device never starves on frame-to-frame jitter; when the queue grows beyond
/// <c>maxQueuedSeconds</c> (default 150 ms, i.e. the emulator is running ahead of the audio clock) the incoming block is
/// dropped.
