/// memory section that WPF's render thread composites straight out of, so the emulator thread writes the picture
/// into its final destination and the UI thread only has to say that it changed
/// (<c>InteropBitmap.Invalidate</c>, from <c>CompositionTarget.Rendering</c>). Nothing is copied at present time.
///
/// The frame's pixels are 0xAARRGGBB with alpha 0xFF, which is byte for byte a <see cref="PixelFormats.Bgra32"/>
/// row on a little-endian machine, so a frame is a handful of row copies rather than a per-channel swizzle.
///
/// The picture is 384 x 272 for the VIC-II and 768 x 272 for the C128's VDC. Frames of the other size are
/// dropped and <see cref="SizeChanged"/> goes true; the window then calls <see cref="CreateBitmap"/> again,
/// which has to happen on the UI thread because an <c>InteropBitmap</c> belongs to the thread that made it.
///
/// Writing while WPF composites can in principle tear, since the buffer is shared rather than double buffered.
/// One frame is a sub-millisecond memcpy against a 20 ms frame interval, so the window for it is very small.
