# Tedd.MOS65xx

A cycle-exact Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 emulator written in C# (.NET 11), with a real 1541 disk drive
emulation and several front-ends: two Windows desktop apps (WPF and .NET MAUI), a browser build (Blazor WebAssembly),
an SDL2 app and a Unity package. The C128 boots BASIC 7 on both its screens and CP/M 3.0 from the included system disks.

Live demo and downloads: https://tedd.no/Tedd.MOS65xx/ (GitHub Pages, also reachable as https://tedd.github.io/Tedd.MOS65xx/; published from the `deploy` branch, see below). Binaries: https://github.com/tedd/Tedd.MOS65xx/releases/latest

## What is emulated

| Part | Model |
|---|---|
| CPU | Cycle-stepped NMOS 6502/6510: every clock is one bus cycle including dummy reads/writes, all 256 opcodes (documented and undocumented), NMOS decimal mode, RDY stalling, interrupt polling quirks (SEI/CLI/branch delays, NMI hijack), SO pin. Verified against all 2.56 million SingleStepTests/65x02 cycle-trace vectors and Klaus Dormann's functional test. |
| VIC-II | PAL 6569, per cycle: bad lines, all graphics modes, sprites with DMA timing and collisions, border unit, raster/collision/light-pen interrupts, register read-back rules. |
| CIA | Two 6526 with the Lorenz delay-pipeline timer model, TOD, serial register, old/new IRQ timing. |
| SID | 6581 following reSID: oscillators, ADSR with the rate-counter bugs, two-integrator filter, resampled output. |
| Memory | PLA with every LORAM/HIRAM/CHAREN/EXROM/GAME configuration incl. Ultimax, 6510 port, color RAM, open-bus reads. |
| Peripherals | Keyboard matrix (both scan directions), two joysticks, RESTORE, 8K/16K/Ultimax cartridges (raw and .CRT type 0), T64/PRG injection. |
| 1541 | Real drive: 6502 at 1 MHz, DOS ROM, two 6522 VIAs, IEC bus with the hardware ATN acknowledge, GCR bit stream at 300 RPM with the four density zones, writes go back into the D64. |

Commodore 128 (`src/Tedd.MOS65xx.Emulator/C128`):

| Part | Model |
|---|---|
| CPUs | The 8502 is the same cycle-stepped core with the C128's port (CAPS LOCK, colour RAM banks), one or two bus cycles per system cycle (2 MHz mode). The Z80A is instruction stepped with the documented T-state counts, all opcodes including the undocumented ones, X/Y flags, WZ/MEMPTR and the Q latch; verified against all 1604 SingleStepTests/z80 vector files. It gets two T-states per system cycle (VICE's model) and only one CPU runs at a time: MMU register $D505 hands the bus over at the next instruction boundary. |
| MMU 8722 | CR/PCR A-D/MCR/RCR/P0/P1/version, the $FF00-$FF04 window, two RAM banks with the common area, page 0/1 relocation (the target page swaps places), CPU select, C64 mode with the cartridge lines. |
| Memory | 128K RAM, BASIC 7 low/high, editor + Z80 BIOS + KERNAL, 8K character ROM (C64 set / C128 set), the C64 mode ROMs, two 1K colour RAM banks, I/O layout with VDC at $D600, the Z80's view (BIOS at $0000 in bank 0, ports $0xxx to the RAM under I/O, $Dxxx to the chips), external function ROM from the cartridge port. |
| VIC-IIe | The C64 VIC plus $D02F (K0-K2 keyboard lines for the 24 extra keys) and $D030 (2 MHz mode: the VIC keeps its timing and interrupts but fetches nothing and never asserts BA). |
| VDC 8563 | 16K (or 64K) video RAM, 37 registers, status with the ready/blank bits and VICE's busy timing, block copy/fill, text with attributes (colour, reverse, blink, underline, alternate set), 640 x 200 bitmap, hardware cursor, 16 MHz raster model; renders a 768 x 272 picture once per VDC frame. Smooth scrolling and interlace are not modelled. |
| Keyboard | The 11 x 8 matrix (three rows driven by the VIC-IIe), the 40/80 DISPLAY and CAPS LOCK toggles. |

## ROM images

The Commodore ROMs are copyrighted and are not part of the repository. Put them in a `roms` folder next to the
executable, in `src/Tedd.MOS65xx.GUI/` when working from source, or point the `C64_ROMS` environment variable
at them:

* `basic.901226-01.bin` (8 KiB) and `kernal.901227-03.bin` (8 KiB), or the combined `64c.251913-01.bin` (16 KiB)
* `characters.901225-01.bin` (4 KiB) or another `characters*.bin`
* optional 1541 ROM: `1541-II.251968-03.bin` (16 KiB) or the pair `1541-c000.325302-01.bin` + `1541-e000.901229-05.bin`

A Commodore 128 additionally needs (same folder; `C128_ROMS` is checked before `C64_ROMS`; all of them are at
https://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/c128/):

* `basic-4000.318018-04.bin` + `basic-8000.318019-04.bin` (16 KiB each), or the combined `basic.318022-02.bin` (32 KiB)
* `kernal.318020-05.bin` (16 KiB: screen editor, Z80 BIOS, KERNAL), or `complete.318023-02.bin` (32 KiB, which also
  contains the C64 mode BASIC and KERNAL)
* `characters.390059-01.bin` (8 KiB: the C64 character set in the lower half, the C128 set in the upper half)
* the C64 BASIC and KERNAL listed above (used in C64 mode) unless the `complete` image is present

There is no free replacement for the C128 ROMs, so the web build only offers the C128 once you have loaded them.

The web build can use [OpenROMs](https://github.com/MEGA65/open-roms) (a free LGPL re-implementation of
BASIC/KERNAL/character set, fetched by `tools/fetch-openroms.sh`; no 1541 DOS) and also lets you upload your
own ROMs, which stay in your browser's local storage.

## Building and testing

Requires the .NET 11 SDK.

```bash
dotnet build src/Tedd.MOS65xx.sln
dotnet test src/Tedd.MOS65xx.Tests/Tedd.MOS65xx.Tests.csproj
```

Slow and data-dependent suites:

* `Category=Slow` includes Klaus Dormann's functional test and the 1541 loading tests.
* `HARTE_6502_TESTS=<dir>` enables the 2.56 million SingleStepTests vectors (download `6502/v1/*.json` from
  https://github.com/SingleStepTests/65x02).
* `HARTE_Z80_TESTS=<dir>` enables the 1.6 million SingleStepTests/z80 vectors (the `v1/*.json` files of
  https://github.com/SingleStepTests/z80, about 1.4 GB); all 1604 files pass.
* The C128 system tests need the C128 ROMs; `Category=Slow` includes booting CP/M 3.0 from `disks/c128` to the `A>` prompt.
* `LORENZ_TESTS=<dir>` enables Wolfgang Lorenz's C64 test-suite (the `*.prg` files from VICE's
  `testprogs/general/Lorenz-2.15/src`), run with `dotnet test -c Release --filter Category=Lorenz`
  (`LORENZ_ONLY=cia1ta,irq` narrows it down). Status: all 221 CPU opcode programs, `trap1`-`trap16`,
  `branchwrap`, `mmufetch`, `mmu`, `cpuport`, `cputiming`, `irq` and every CIA timer program (`cia1ta/tb`,
  `cia2ta/tb`, `*pb6/7`, `*tb123`, `cia1tab`, `icr01`, `imr`, `flipos`, `oneshot`, `cntdef`, `cnto2`, `loadth`)
  pass; `nmi` (NMI arriving during BRK) and `trap17` are still open.

Rendering tests write PNG frames to `TestResults/` next to the test assembly.

## Front-ends

* **WPF** (`src/Tedd.MOS65xx.GUI`): Machine menu to switch between the Commodore 64 and 128 (remembered), the C128's
  40/80 DISPLAY and CAPS LOCK keys and which screen to show (the window resizes for the 80 column picture), attach D64/T64/PRG/CRT, autostart, screenshots, freeze + memory viewer/editor
  with cycle/instruction/frame stepping, sprite viewer (all eight sprites zoomed, with their registers, DMA state
  and position on screen), character set viewer (the ROM sets or the 2 KiB the VIC is reading live, per character
  screen/PETSCII codes and addresses, and loading a different character set over the running machine), key binding
  editor (Tools menu) where you pick the keys that make up the joysticks, audio visualizer window.
* **MAUI** (`src/Tedd.MOS65xx.Maui`): the WPF front-end above, feature for feature, on .NET MAUI - the same
  windows, the same key bindings file, and the tool windows redrawn with `Microsoft.Maui.Graphics` so they are
  not tied to Windows. Every picture made of C64 pixels - the screen, the character set grid, a blown up
  character, the sprites and their thumbnails - is written into a `Tedd.WriteableBitmap.Maui` bitmap at one
  bitmap pixel per C64 pixel and magnified by the GPU with nearest neighbour sampling, so a repaint costs what
  the machine has rather than what the screen shows, and stays sharp at any zoom; grids, boxes and labels are
  drawn in screen pixels on a transparent canvas over it. Only the Windows head is built
  (`net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, because the .NET 11 MAUI workload is not published yet); the emulator picture,
  sound, the save dialog and the physical key reader are the four pieces behind a platform boundary, so adding a
  macOS, Android or iOS head means installing that workload, adding the TFM and implementing those.
* **Web** (`src/Tedd.MOS65xx.Web`): runs entirely in the browser (video on a canvas, audio through an AudioWorklet),
  machine selector, C128 ROM slots, a menu that boots the shipped CP/M disks, the 40/80 key, drag-and-drop media,
  touch joystick, built-in tech demo.
* **SDL2** (`src/Tedd.MOS65xx.Sdl`): `Tedd.MOS65xx.Sdl --roms <dir> --disk game.d64 --autostart`, `--machine c128 --80`
  for a C128 on its 80 column screen, game controller support.
* **Unity** (`unity/com.tedd.mos65xx`): UPM package with a `C64Emulator` MonoBehaviour that renders to a texture and
  plays audio through `OnAudioFilterRead`; build the DLLs with `tools/build-unity-package.ps1`.

All front-ends share `Tedd.MOS65xx.Hosting`: implement `IVideoSink`/`IAudioSink`, translate your key events to
W3C `KeyboardEvent.code` names and call `EmulatorSession.RunFrame()` from your loop (or use `EmulatorRunner`). A
session is created from a `RomSet` (C64) or a `C128RomSet` (C128); `VideoFrame` carries its own geometry because a
C128 switches between the 384 x 272 VIC-II picture and the 768 x 272 VDC picture (`EmulatorSession.Display`).

Booting CP/M: attach `disks/c128/cpm.system.622-580745.d64` to a C128 with the drive enabled and reset (the session
does that for you when autostart is on and the disk has a boot sector). The 1541 needs about two minutes of emulated
time to load `CPM+.SYS`, so turn on warp.

## Deployment

Pushing the `deploy` branch runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: it tests the solution, publishes the Windows
builds (WPF and MAUI) and the SDL2 builds as a GitHub Release, and publishes the web site + browser emulator to GitHub Pages
(enable *Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions* once).
